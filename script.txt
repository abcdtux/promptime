Format:
Delay (in s) & Texte
A comment line starts with the character #.

The script begins with the line '# begin' or at the start of the file if it's not present,
and ends with the line '# end' or at the end of the file if this line is not present.

If the delay of a line is not specified, it takes the default value of 5 (5 seconds). 
This value can be modified by adding a line 'DefaultDelay=...' 
at the beginning or before the start of the script.

In addition to the currently read line, the display includes the 3 previous lines and the 7 following lines.
These line numbers can be modified using 'NbLineBefore=...' and 'NbLineAfter=...'

Note: The names of variables and the keywords 'begin' and 'end' are case-insensitive 
(both uppercase and lowercase are accepted). They can even contain extra spaces.

DefaultDelay=7
NbLineBefore=2
NbLineAfter=8
